TextVotingApp
=============

A text-based voting system (like on American Idol) using Twilio

Written for Mr. Engineer, an annual nerd beauty pageant held at UMKC during 
Engineer's Week in February. It was created in order to help tally votes as 
well as to help curb cheating during the competition when the audience voted 
for their favorite contestant. 

Note: I wrote this last year (2013) and it was very thrown together at the last 
minute. I removed passwords, images, and API keys, but there are likely extra 
files not needed and likely won't work out of the box. The database schema 
isn't in here currently either, I'll do that soon. I just wanted to post this 
in hopes maybe someone else might find it beneficial.
